resultsï¼šRecords the image data in the article.Recording _of_subcircuit Corresponding to Figure 2.noiseless_results Corresponding to Figure 3,4,5.mitigation_error_resultsCorresponding to Figure 6.
venv:The complete environment used by the code.
Sample_random_samples and plot_trace_distance :The trace distance between the obtained mixed states and the maximum mixed state is plotted by sampling the order in which the quantum gate operations are recorded at different system sizes.
Pauli_operator_scrambling ,Calculate_holevo_information,and heat_maps:The evolution details of the local operators are obtained by setting different initial operators and conditions, and then the Holevo information is calculated to draw the heat map.
HolevoinformationIX_noise_random,HolevoinformationXY_noise_Bell:Two methods are provided, the efficient approximation method we proposed in the article and the exact measurement method, the details of which can be adjusted.
